        <dt><h3>Luka Modric</h3></dt>

        <ul>
            <dt><li><h5>Playing Style</h5></li></dt>
            <dd>If there is one thing the midfielder stands out for, it’s his technical ability. Since his early days at Dinamo Zagreb, Modric has shown a great coordination capacity that has allowed him to successfully solve many complex on-pitch situations throughout his career.<br/>For example, in moments of intense pressure from one or more players of the opposition, Modric usually escapes without any problem, using a myriad of technical resources such as turns with the ball or dribbling, of a qualitative level that is difficult to match.</dd>

            <dt><li><h5>Career</h5></li></dt>
            <dd>Luka began his career at Dinamo Zagreb in 2003 and his five years with the club included loan spells at Zrinjski Mostar and Inker Zapresic. After five seasons with Zagreb he moved to England where he signed for Juande Ramos at Tottenham Hotspur.<br/>In August 2012, after four years in London, Luka signed for Real Madrid.Luka made his senior international debut for Croatia against Argentina in March 2006.</dd>

            <dt><li><h5>Trophies</h5></li></dt>
            <dd> Modrić 's spectacular track record as Real Madrid players includes: 6  European Cups  ( the competition's all-time record ), 5  Club World Cups , 4  European Super Cups , 4  LaLiga  titles, 2  Copas del Rey  and 5  Spanish Super Cups .</dd>

        <dd>Calm and composed no player can dominate midfeild like him.Kroos retirement made everyone go through so many emotions.</dd>
        <ul>
            <dt><li><h5>Playing Style</h5></li></dt>
            <dd>Kroos plays mainly as a central midfielder, but has also been deployed as a deep-lying playmaker in his career.</dd>
